<%# Since the Comments route is nested within the Posts route, the "simple_form_for [post, comment]" notation in this partial will call the 'create' action in comments controller passing post_id and comment_id in the request url upon submit - i.e. the new_post_comment route is called.
Hence, the submit button calls the create action on the comments controller with post_id and comments_id as params. %>

<%= simple_form_for [post, comment],remote: true do |f| %>
  <%= f.error_notification %>

  <div class="form-inputs">
  	<%= f.hidden_field :group_id, :value => group_id %>
    <%= f.input :body, placeholder: 'Reply', label: false %>
  </div>

  <div class="form-actions">
    <%= f.button :submit, 'Post Reply'%>
  </div>
<% end %>
