<%# This does not go the 'new' action of Comments Controller
A new comment object is created and passed via the locals hash
Since the Comments route is nested within the Posts route, the "simple_form_for [post, comment]" notiation in comments/new_post_comment partial will call create a form that passes the post_id and comment_id in the request url upon submit - i.e. the new_post_comment route is called.
Hence the submit button calls the create action on the comments controller with post_id and comments_id as params. %>
